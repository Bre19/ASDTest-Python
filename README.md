# ASDTest-Python
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that incurs considerable healthcare costs. Early diagnosis can greatly reduce these expenses. However, current waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy, and the procedures are not cost-effective. The rapid increase in ASD cases worldwide underscores the need for datasets related to behavioral traits. However, such datasets are scarce, making it challenging to conduct comprehensive analyses to enhance the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Currently, only a limited number of autism datasets associated with clinical or screening processes are available, and most of these are genetic in nature. To address this gap, we propose a new dataset focused on autism screening in toddlers, which includes influential features for further analysis. This dataset comprises ten behavioral features (Q-Chat-10) along with other individual characteristics that have been proven effective in distinguishing ASD cases from controls in behavioral science.
